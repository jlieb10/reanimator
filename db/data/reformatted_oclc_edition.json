There is in England no more real or typical district than Thomas Hardy's imaginary Wessex, the scattered fields and farms of which were first discovered in Far from the Madding Crowd. It is here that Gabriel Oak observes Bathsheba, the young mistress of Weatherbury Farm, fall victim to her amorous caprices. He stands by her through one marriage to a handsome, corruptly sentimental sergeant. Selflessly altruistic, he sees her through another betrothal to her compulsive, puritanical neighbor-as unaware as she of the stroke of Fate that will effect their ultimate union. Published anonymously and first attributed to George Eliot, Far from the Madding Crowd won Hardy immediate success; it combines an architecturally perfect plot with the philosophical overtones that were to set the theme for all his later works. The text of this Signet Classic is set from Hardy's revised final version of Far from the Madding Crowd , published in 1912 in the authoritative Wessex edition.","@language":"en"},{"@value":"Description of Farmer Oak -- An Incident -- Night -- The Flock -- An Interior -- Another Interior -- A Girl on Horseback -- Conversation -- Gabriel's Resolve -- The Visit -- The Mistake -- Departure of Bathsheba -- A Pastoral Tragedy -- The Fair -- The Journey -- The Fire -- Recognition -- A Timid Girl -- The Malthouse -- The Chat -- News -- The Homestead-A Visitor -- Half-Confidences -- Mistress and Men -- Outside the Barracks -- Snow -- A Meeting -- Farmers -- A Rule -- An Exception -- Sortes Sanctorum -- The Valentine -- Effect of the Letter -- Sunrise -- A Morning Meeting -- The Letter again -- All Saints' and All Souls' -- In the Market-place -- Boldwood in Meditation -- Regret -- The Sheep-washing -- The Offer -- Perplexity -- binding the Shears -- A Quarrel -- Troubles in the Fold -- A Message -- The Great Barn and the Sheep-shearers -- Eventide -- A Second Declaration -- The same Night -- The Fir Plantation -- The New Acquaintance described -- Scene on the Verge of the Hay-mead -- Hiving the Bees -- The Hollow amid the Ferns -- Particulars of a Twilight Walk -- Hot Cheeks and Tearful Eyes -- Blame -- Fury -- Night -- Horses tramping -- In the Sun -- A Harbinger -- Home again -- A Trickster -- At an Upper Window -- Wealth in Jeopardy -- The Revel -- The Storm -- The Two together -- Rain -- One Solitary meets another -- Coming Home -- Cry -- On Casterbridge Highway -- Suspicion -- Fanny is sent for -- Joseph and his Burden -- Buck's Head -- Fanny's Revenge -- Under a Tree -- Reaction -- Troy's Romanticism -- The Gurgoyle: its Doings -- Adventures by the Shore -- Doubts arise -- Doubts hunger -- Oak's Advancement -- A Great Hope -- The Sheep Fair -- Troy touches his Wife's Hand -- Bathsheba talks with her Outrider -- Converging Courses -- Concurritur -- Horæ Momento -- After the Shock -- The March Following -- 'Bathsheba Boldwood' -- Beauty in Loneliness -- After All -- A Foggy Night and Morning -- Conclusion -- Selected bibliography.","@language":"en"}],"language":"en","title":"Far from the madding crowd","datePublished":"2002","isbns":["9780613529570","061352957X","0451528565","9780451528568"],"id":"OCLC-49799702"},{"publisher":"Pearson Education Ltd","language":"en","title":"Far from the Madding Crowd","datePublished":"1999","isbns":["0582417643","9780582417649","9780582430112","0582430119"],"id":"OCLC-806427352"},{"publisher":"Wordsworth Editions","language":"en","title":"Far from the madding crowd","datePublished":"2000","isbns":["1853260673","9781853260674"],"id":"OCLC-50448600"},{"publisher":"Oxford University Press","language":"en","title":"Far from the madding crowd","datePublished":"1985","isbns":["9780194241793","0194241793"],"id":"OCLC-439937324"},{"publisher":"Floating Press","language":"en","title":"Far from the madding crowd","datePublished":"2009","isbns":["1775411125","9781775411123"],"id":"OCLC-588907479"},{"publisher":"Wordsworth Classics","language":"en","title":"Far from the madding crowd.","datePublished":"1993","isbns":["1853260673","9781853260674"],"id":"OCLC-794962299"},{"publisher":"Oxford University Press","description":"\"Bathsheba Everdene is young, proud, and beautiful.

Though it was first published anonymously in 1874, the quick and tremendous success of Far from the Madding Crowd persuaded Hardy to give up his first profession, architecture, to concentrate on writing fiction. The story of the ill-fated passions of the beautiful Bathsheba Everdene and her three suitors offers a spectacle of country life brimming with an energy and charm not customarily associated with Hardy. ('When Farmer Oak smiled,' the novel begins, 'the corners of his mouth spread till they were within an unimportant distance of his ears. . . .') The text is based on the authoritative Wessex Edition of 1912, revised and corrected by Hardy himself. This edition is the companion volume to the Mobil Masterpiece Theatre WGBH television presentation broadcast on PBS. It stars Paloma Baeza as Bathsheba Everdene, Nathaniel Parker as Gabriel Oak, Nigel Terry as Mr. Boldwood, and Jonathan Firth as Frank Troy. Adapted by Philomena McDonagh, Far from the Madding Crowd is directed by Nick Renton.","language":"en","title":"Far from the madding crowd","datePublished":"2013","isbns":["9780679641506","0679641505"],"id":"OCLC-869474961"},{"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","description":"\"It is among such communities as these that happiness will find her last refuge on earth...\" Against this backdrop Hardy tells a vivid story of life in rural Wessex which centres on the independent and beautiful Bathsheba Everdene.

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences&#151;biographical, historical, and literary&#151;to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. <P style=MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt class=MsoNormal>The first of Thomas Hardy's great novels, Far From the Madding Crowd established the author as one of Britain's foremost writers. It also introduced readers to Wessex, an imaginary county in southwestern England that served as the pastoral setting for many of the author's later works. Far From the Madding Crowd tells the story of beautiful Bathsheba Everdene, a fiercely independent woman who inherits a farm and decides to run it herself. She rejects a marriage proposal from Gabriel Oak, a loyal man who takes a job on her farm after losing his own in an unfortunate accident. He is forced to watch as Bathsheba mischievously flirts with her neighbor, Mr. Boldwood, unleashing a passionate obsession deep within the reserved man. But both suitors are soon eclipsed by the arrival of the dashing soldier, Frank Troy, who falls in love with Bathsheba even though he's still smitten with another woman. His reckless presence at the farm drives Boldwood mad with jealousy, and sets off a dramatic chain of events that leads to both murder and marriage. A delicately woven tale of unrequited love and regret, Far from the Madding Crowd is also an unforgettable portrait of a rural culture that, by Hardy's lifetime, had become threatened with extinction at the hands of ruthless industrialization. <P style=MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt class=MsoNormal>Jonathan A. Cook has a B.A. from Harvard College and a Ph.D. from Columbia University.

There is in England no more real or typical district than Thomas Hardy's imaginary Wessex, the scattered fields and farms of which were first discovered in Far from the Madding Crowd. It is here that Gabriel Oak observes Bathsheba, the young mistress of Weatherbury Farm, fall victim to her amorous caprices. He stands by her through one marriage to a handsome, corruptly sentimental sergeant. Selflessly altruistic, he sees her through another betrothal to her compulsive, puritanical neighbor-as unaware as she of the stroke of Fate that will effect their ultimate union. Published anonymously and first attributed to George Eliot, Far from the Madding Crowd won Hardy immediate success; it combines an architecturally perfect plot with the philosophical overtones that were to set the theme for all his later works. The text of this Signet Classic is set from Hardy's revised final version of Far from the Madding Crowd , published in 1912 in the authoritative Wessex edition.","language":"en","title":"Far from the

She strikes up a friendship with a neighbor, Gabriel Oak, and even saves the young shepherd's life. But when he responds by asking for her hand in marriage, she refuses. She cannot sacrifice her independence for a man she does not love.Years later, misfortune has bankrupted Gabriel, while Bathsheba has inherited her uncle's estate and is now a wealthy woman. She hires Gabriel as a shepherd but is interested in William Boldwood, a prosperous farmer whose reticence inspires her to playfully send him a valentine. William, like Gabriel before him, quickly falls in love with Bathsheba and proposes. But it is the dashing Sergeant Francis Troy who finally wins her heart. Despite the warnings of her first two suitors, Bathsheba accepts his proposal, a decision that brings long-buried secrets to the fore and leaves everything for which she has fought so hard hanging in the balance.Published a century and a half ago, Far from the Madding Crowd was Thomas Hardy's first major success and introduced the themes he would continue to explore for the rest of his life. A love story wrapped in the cloak of tragedy, it is widely considered to be one of the finest novels of the nineteenth century.This ebook has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices.","language":"en","title":"Far from the madding crowd","datePublished":"2014","isbns":["1480493597","9781480493599"],"id":"OCLC-879647253"},{"publisher":"Penguin books","language":"en","title":"Far from the madding crowd","datePublished":"1994","isbns":["0140620478","9780140620474"],"id":"OCLC-797608249"},{"publisher":"Longman","language":"en","title":"Far from the madding crowd","datePublished":"1987","isbns":["058200263X","9780582002630"],"id":"OCLC-822619273"},{"publisher":"Oxford University Press","language":"en","title":"Far from the madding crowd","datePublished":"1979","isbns":["9780194241793","0194241793"],"id":"OCLC-441477023"},{"description":"Independent and spirited Bathsheba Everdene has come to Weatherbury to take up her position as a farmer on the largest estate in the area.

There is in England no more real or typical district than Thomas Hardy's imaginary Wessex, the scattered fields and farms of which were first discovered in Far from the Madding Crowd. It is here that Gabriel Oak observes Bathsheba, the young mistress of Weatherbury Farm, fall victim to her amorous caprices. He stands by her through one marriage to a handsome, corruptly sentimental sergeant. Selflessly altruistic, he sees her through another betrothal to her compulsive, puritanical neighbor-as unaware as she of the stroke of Fate that will effect their ultimate union. Published anonymously and first attributed to George Eliot, Far from the Madding Crowd won Hardy immediate success; it combines an architecturally perfect plot with the philosophical overtones that were to set the theme for all his later works. The text of this Signet Classic is set from Hardy's revised final version of Far from the Madding Crowd , published in 1912 in the authoritative Wessex edition.","language":"en","title":"Far from the

The world has mourned his loss greatly, no one more so than his good friend and partner in the arts of detection, Dr. Watson. Imagine Watson&rsquo;s shock, then, when an elderly book collector he bumps into on the street turns out to be none other than the master sleuth himself. Despite all evidence to the contrary, Sherlock Holmes did not die in Switzerland&mdash;he vanquished his greatest foe and set a trap for every other would-be mastermind foolish enough to attempt to match wits with the world&rsquo;s greatest detective. From the astonishing revelation in the opening paragraphs of &ldquo;The Adventure of the Empty House&rdquo; to the motiveless murder at the heart of &ldquo;The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez&rdquo; to the kidnapping that sets in motion the plot of &ldquo;The Adventure of the Priory School,&rdquo; these thirteen classic stories are among the most entertaining and endlessly clever entries in the canon of Sherlock Holmes.

But Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's readers were desperate for more of Holmes' adventures, so he brought the character back in the first short story in this collection, \"The Empty House.\" Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories have been adapted numerous times, including the 2009 and 2011 movies starring Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr., and for the popular television shows Elementary, starring Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu, and the BBC's Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. The first episode of Sherlock's third series, named \"The Empty Hearse,\" references \"The Empty House\" from this volume.

Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. Specific plot points and events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.","language":"en","title":"Treasure Island","datePublished":"2012","isbns":["9781612184166","1612184162"],"id":"OCLC-845328658"},{"publisher":"Oxford University Press","language":"en","title":"Treasure island","datePublished":"1985","isbns":["9780192816818","0192816810"],"id":"OCLC-489842409"},{"publisher":"Rand McNally","description":"While going through the possessions of a deceased guest who owed them money, the mistress of the inn and her son find a treasure map that leads them to a pirate's fortune.","language":"en","title":"Treasure Island","datePublished":"1983","isbns":["0528823671","9780528823671"],"id":"OCLC-19004486"},{"publisher":"Collins Clear-Type Press","description":"While going through the possessions of a deceased guest who owed them money, the mistress of the inn and her son find a treasure map that leads them to a pirate's fortune.","language":"en","title":"Treasure Island.","datePublished":"","isbns":[],"id":"OCLC-48378491"},{"publisher":"Raintree Publishers","description":"While going through the possessions of a deceased guest who owed them money, the mistress of the inn and her son find a treasure map that leads them to a pirate's fortune.","language":"en","title":"Treasure Island","datePublished":"1980","isbns":[],"id":"OCLC-761924938"},{"publisher":"Profesor Johnson Ediciones","language":"en","title":"Treasure island","datePublished":"2013","isbns":["8494122002","9788494122002"],"id":"OCLC-864288139"},{"publisher":"Players Press","description":"The classic Robert Louis Stevenson story retold and adapted for the stage.","language":"en","title":"Treasure Island","datePublished":"1991","isbns":["9780887344121","0887344127"],"id":"OCLC-23384802"},{"publisher":"Sisa Munhwasa","language":"en","title":[{"@value":"Treasure Island = Pomulsŏm","@language":"en"},{"@value":"Pomulsŏm","@language":"en"}],"datePublished":"1978","isbns":["9788973231881","897323188X","9788973239863","8973239864"],"id":"OCLC-32441622"},{"publisher":"Charles Scribner's","language":"en","title":"Treasure Island","datePublished":["1897","1981"],"isbns":["0684171600","9780684171609"],"id":"OCLC-818813958"},{"publisher":"1st World Library","description":"The mistress of an inn and her son find a treasure map that leads to a pirate fortune as well as great danger.","language":"en","title":"Treasure Island","datePublished":"2005","isbns":["9781421808659","142180865X"],"id":"OCLC-75562029"},{"publisher":"Cassell","description":"While going through the possessions of a deceased guest who owed them money, the mistress of the inn and her son find a treasure map that leads to a pirate fortune as well as great danger.","language":"en","title":"Treasure Island","datePublished":"1883","isbns":[],"id":"OCLC-610014604"},{"publisher":"Puffin Books","language":"en","title":"Treasure island","datePublished":"1984","isbns":["0140350160","9780140350166"],"id":"OCLC-489862073"},{"publisher":"Hueber","language":"en","title":"Treasure Island","datePublished":"2005","isbns":["9783191829575","3191829571"],"id":"OCLC-181455533"},{"publisher":"Ladybird Books","language":"en","title":"Treasure Island","datePublished":"1979","isbns":["0721405975","9780721405971"],"id":"OCLC-474003963"},{"publisher":"Parragon","description":"While going through the possessions of a deceased guest who owed them money, the mistress of the inn and her son find a treasure map that leads them to a pirate's fortune.","language":"en","title":"Treasure Island","datePublished":"2004","isbns":["1405437731","9781405437738"],"id":"OCLC-59821157"},{"publisher":"Foreign Language Teaching & Research Pr.","language":"en","title":"Treasure island.","datePublished":"1995","isbns":["7560009859","9787560009858"],"id":"OCLC-657942970"},{"publisher":"Reprinted by Hsin Lu Book Co","description":"When a boy and his mother search the belongings of a deceased sailor who owed them money they find a treasure map.

But above all, Treasure Island is a complex study of good and evil, as embodied by that hero-villain, Long John Silver; the merry unscrupulous buccaneer-rogue whose greedy lust for gold cannot help but win the heart of every one who ever longed for romance, treasure, and adventure. Since its publication in 1883, Treasure Island has provided an enduring literary model for such eminent writers as Anthony Hope, Graham Greene, and Jorge Luis Borges.

to be written, and one of the last to be published, Northanger Abbey is both an amusing story of how a naive girl enters society and wins the affection of a witty young clergyman, and a high-spirited parody of the lurid gothic novels that were popular during Austen's youth. In the process it features a vivid account of social life in the late eighteenth-century Bath, and Austen's famous defence of the novel as a literary form. This edition, based on the text of the novel as published posthumously in 1818, is accompanied by explanatory notes and an appendix summarizing the plots and situations of the gothic fictions that form the basis of much of Austen's comedy. In addition there is an extensive introduction covering the context, publication, and critical history of the novel, a chronology of Austen's life, and authoritative textual apparatus.--Book jacket.","@language":"en"},{"@value":"Chronology -- Northanger Abbey -- Corrections and emendations to 1818 text -- Appendix : summaries and extracts from Ann Radcliffe's novels.","@language":"en"}],"language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"2006","isbns":["0511256884","9780511256882"],"id":"OCLC-252531518"},{"publisher":"Penguin Books","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"1977","isbns":["0140430741","9780140430745"],"id":"OCLC-633884663"},{"publisher":"Penguin Books","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"2006","isbns":["0141028130","9780141028132"],"id":"OCLC-780542231"},{"publisher":"Signet Classics","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey.","datePublished":"1995","isbns":["9780451526366","0451526368"],"id":"OCLC-784057271"},{"publisher":"Dent","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"1970","isbns":["0460010255","9780460010252"],"id":"OCLC-248144669"},{"publisher":"Pearson Education","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"2011","isbns":["1408232146","9781408232149"],"id":"OCLC-850762652"},{"publisher":"Digireads.com","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"2005","isbns":["1420925334","9781420925333"],"id":"OCLC-775074973"},{"publisher":"W.W.

The satirical Northanger Abbey pokes fun at the gothic novel while earnestly emphasizing caution to the female sex.","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"2007","isbns":["9780553903966","0553903969"],"id":"OCLC-236138200"},{"publisher":"Giunti","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"2008","isbns":["8809020731","9788809020733"],"id":"OCLC-799546623"},{"publisher":"Modern Library","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"1995","isbns":["9780679601920","0679601929"],"id":"OCLC-832703501"},{"publisher":"Pan Books","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"1968","isbns":["9780330021920","0330021923"],"id":"OCLC-14511445"},{"publisher":"Cambridge Univ.

This edition, based on the text of the novel as published posthumously in 1818, is accompanied by explanatory notes and an appendix summarizing the plots and situations of the gothic fictions that form the basis of much of Austen's comedy. In addition there is an extensive introduction covering the context, publication, and critical history of the novel, a chronology of Austen's life, and authoritative textual apparatus.--Book jacket."],"language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":["2006","2013"],"isbns":["1107620414","9781107620414"],"id":"OCLC-880349858"},{"publisher":"HarperCollins","language":"en","title":"Northanger abbey","datePublished":"2010","isbns":["9780007368600","0007368607"],"id":"OCLC-758317435"},{"publisher":"Wordsworth","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":["1993","1994"],"isbns":["9781853260438","1853260436"],"id":"OCLC-832568888"},{"publisher":"Broadview Press","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"2002","isbns":["1551114798","9781551114798"],"id":"OCLC-804686061"},{"publisher":"Knopf Publishing","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"2006","isbns":["9780307290892","0307290891"],"id":"OCLC-798637598"},{"publisher":"Sovereign","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"2012","isbns":["9781909175372","1909175374"],"id":"OCLC-816519481"},{"publisher":"Zodiac Press","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"1988","isbns":["9780701112349","0701112344"],"id":"OCLC-250011610"},{"description":"When Catherine Morland is taken to Bath to \"come out\" in society, she meets Henry Tilney, a young clergyman, and his sister.

Centred on the loves and friendships of Catherine Morland, an endearing young girl extremely fond of novel-reading, it remains the most youthful and optimistic of Jane Austen's novels. During an eventful season in Bath, Catherine meets the sophisticated Henry and Eleanor Tilney who invite her to stay at their father's mysterious house, Northanger Abbey. There Catherine runs into dangers, imaginary and real, and learns how to tell the difference between books and real life, false friends and true. For this completely new edition, Marilyn Butler provides an accurate text based on the first edition complete with introduction and notes. By placing Northanger Abbey firmly in its literary and topical context, Marilyn Butler shows that it is a more sophisticated novel than is often thought, and a sharp social commentary on a consumerist world to which modern readers can easily relate.","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"1995","isbns":["9780140434132","0140434135"],"id":"OCLC-34742761"},{"publisher":"Premier Classics","description":"Catherine Morland, the daughter of a country parson, is the innocent abroad who gains worldly wisdom: first in the fashionable society of Bath and then at Northanger Abbey itself, where she learns not to interpret the world through her reading of gothic thrillers.","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":["1995","2009"],"isbns":["9780307290892","0307290891"],"id":"OCLC-864544690"},{"publisher":"Bigelow, Brown & Co.","description":"Northanger Abbey -- Lady Susan.","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":["","1905"],"isbns":[],"id":"OCLC-2453694"},{"publisher":"BiblioBazaar","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"2006","isbns":["9781426455063","1426455062"],"id":"OCLC-230825718"},{"publisher":"Wordsworth","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"1993","isbns":["9781853260438","1853260436"],"id":"OCLC-758097890"},{"publisher":"Wordsworth","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"1994","isbns":["9781853260438","1853260436"],"id":"OCLC-877537639"},{"publisher":"Sourcebooks Landmark","description":"This special edition of Northanger Abbey includes the famous illustrations by Henry Matthew Brock, originally created in 1898. Brock and his brothers were all successful illustrators of the day and often posed for each other using costumes, props and furniture in their Cambridge studio. Brock's older brother Charles joined him in illustrating other Jane Austen releases for this set of 1898 editions. Northanger Abbey was Austen's first completed novel but was published posthumously in 1817. Austen sold the novel to a bookseller in 1803 ? for 10 - who decided not to publish it. Her brother bought it back for the same amount after her death. Catherine Morland is the daughter of a country clergyman, one of ten children. She devours Gothic novels and has an active imagination. After a lively season in Bath, she is invited to Northanger Abbey, where she finds the house is not the dark, moody Gothic mansion of her imaginings. Catherine's exciting season in Bath leads her to become acquainted with the dashing John Thorpe, who encourages her flights of fancy and attempts to divert her from his rival Henry Tilney. But Henry extends an invitation she can't resist and she finds herself visiting Northanger Abbey. There, as a heroine in training, she is determined to bring one of her favorite Gothic novels to life, but the charming and very down to earth Mr. Tilney eventually brings her to see that real life can be even more interesting than the most spine-chilling Gothic fantasy.","language":"en","title":"Northanger Abbey","datePublished":"2012","isbns":["1402256833","9781402256837"],"id":"OCLC-823253351"},{"publisher":"Penguin Books","description":"Catherine Morland meets all the trappings of Gothic horror and imagines the worst.

Catherine Morland ist für Jane Austen eine ungewöhnliche Romanheldin: zwar ist sie jung und tugendhaft, aber weder ausnehmend schön noch besonders elegant, und als Tochter eines Geistlichen keine sonderlich gute Partie. Ihr Hauptinteresse gilt Büchern und deren Figuren und entsprechend naiv verhält sie sich im realen Leben. Bald aber lernt auch sie, auf ihre Gefühle zu hören und verwandelt sich in eine liebenswürdige junge Frau, die die Männerwelt verzaubert. Ihr Herz schlägt für den gebildeten, wohlerzogenen Henry Tilney, dessen Schwester sie auf den Landsitz der Familie einlädt. Doch die Aura des alten Anwesens Northanger Abbey beflügelt Catherines Phantasie: sie glaubt, einem düsteren Familiengeheimnis auf die Spur gekommen zu sein.

The famous opening reveals the haunting power of that dark, forbidding moor where proud Eustacia fervently awaits a clandestine meeting with her lover, Damon Wildeve. But Eustacia's dreams of escape are not to be realized'neither Wildeve nor the returning native Clym Yeobright can bring her salvation. Injured by forces beyond their control, Hardy's characters struggle vainly in the net of destiny. In the end, only the face of the lonely heath remains untouched by fate in this masterpiece of tragic passion, a tale that perfectly epitomizes the author's own unique and melancholy genius.

Though set in a small space (Egdon Heath in the fictional county of Wessex) and short time (the main action spans a year and a day), the novel addresses the broad social and intellectual upheavals of the Victorian age. Much of this turmoil is embodied in the character of Eustacia Vye, the novel's wilful female protagonist. A complex, independent young woman, Eustacia is a sympathetic but ultimately tragic figure, the epitome of what the narrator calls the \"irrepressible New.\" The appendices to this Broadview edition place the novel in the context of Hardy's career and the scientific and social ideas of the time. Documents include contemporary reviews, related writings by Hardy, and materials on biology, geology, and the \"Woman Question.\" Illustrations from the original serialization in Belgravia magazine and Hardy's performance text of the mummers' play are also included.\"--Publisher's website.","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"2013","isbns":["1554810701","9781554810703"],"id":"OCLC-820108054"},{"publisher":"Heinemann","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"1992","isbns":["9780435272661","0435272667"],"id":"OCLC-777323160"},{"publisher":"Pan Books","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"1978","isbns":["9780330241977","0330241974"],"id":"OCLC-59854365"},{"publisher":"Penguin Books","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"1999","isbns":["0140435182","9780140435184"],"id":"OCLC-646715908"},{"publisher":"Ægypan Press","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"2006","isbns":["9781598186444","1598186442"],"id":"OCLC-232651253"},{"publisher":"Heinemann","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"1992","isbns":["9780435272661","0435272667"],"id":"OCLC-490988578"},{"publisher":"Longman","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"1994","isbns":["9780582023000","0582023009"],"id":"OCLC-490033820"},{"publisher":"Pendulum Press","description":"A cartoon version of the story of love lost and found set amidst the somber moor country in England.","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"1978","isbns":["0883013193","9780883013199"],"id":"OCLC-7233487"},{"publisher":"Oxford University Press","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"2008","isbns":["0199537046","9780199537044"],"id":"OCLC-823820327"},{"publisher":"Penguin","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"2012","isbns":["0141199741","9780141199740","9780141974699","0141974699"],"id":"OCLC-779863460"},{"publisher":"Penguin Books","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"1999","isbns":["0140435182","9780140435184"],"id":"OCLC-40840173"},{"publisher":"Oxford Univ.

Wonderful descriptions of the English countryside underscore a rural tale of doomed love, passion, and melancholy. The novel opens with the famous portrait of Egdon Heath, the wild, haunted Wessex moor that D. H. Lawrence called 'the real stuff of tragedy' of the book. The heath's changing face mirrors the fortunes of the farmers, innkeepers, sons, mothers, and lovers that populate the novel. The 'native' is Clym Yeobright, coming home from a successful, cosmopolitan life in Paris, a place far removed from the unforgiving landscape of Egdon Heath. He finds that his cousin, Thomasin, is about to marry Damon Wildeve, a rakish and confused man with a lover, Eustacia Vye, whom he cannot forget. Eustacia is willful, ambitious, and dangerously alluring. Hardy describes her as 'the raw material of a divinity. . . . She had Pagan eyes, full of nocturnal mysteries.' As the characters are drawn together, they scheme and maneuver, often under the eye of Diggory Venn, the reddleman whose relentless virtue must find its reward at the violent climax of the novel. The Return of the Native was first published in Belgravia magazine in twelve parts in 1878 and revised by Hardy in 1895 and in 1912, when he produced the definitive Wessex Edition of all of his novels. Described on publication by Harper's magazine as 'delightful reading,' it has retained its power to move and absorb the reader and stands with The Mayor of Casterbridge and Jude the Obscure among the finest of Hardy's works.","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"2013","isbns":["9780679641520","0679641521"],"id":"OCLC-869474894"},{"publisher":"ICON Classics","language":"en","title":"Return of the native","datePublished":"2005","isbns":["1423779045","9781423779049"],"id":"OCLC-70150978"},{"publisher":"Macmillan","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"1974","isbns":["0312679017","9780333168844","0333168844","9780312679019"],"id":"OCLC-1837160"},{"publisher":"ProQuest LLC","description":"Literature Online includes the KnowledgeNotes student guides, a unique collection of critical introductions to major literary works.

An enchantress would be at home in this place, but not Eustacia Vye. Though coveted by every man in Egdon Heath--and every boy old enough to stare--the beautiful Eustacia longs for the smoking chimneys and broad stone buildings of Paris. When a native of Egdon Heath, Clym Yeobright, returns from his job in Paris as a jeweler, Vye stuns him with her beauty and marries him in hopes of persuading him to take her to Paris. But, alas, Clym is a clod at heart. He vows to remain in Egdon Heath to teach and edify. After his eyesight deteriorates, Eustacia turns her attentions to rakish Damon Wildeve, and the plot begins to churn and curdle.","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"2008","isbns":["9780553905564","0553905562"],"id":"OCLC-276557693"},{"publisher":"Barnes & Noble","description":"The Return of the Native, by Thomas Hardy, is part of the <A href=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/classics/index.asp?z=y&cds2Pid=16447&sLinkPrefix>Barnes & Noble Classics</A> series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences&#151;biographical, historical, and literary&#151;to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. A haunting tale of romantic self-deception, The Return of the Native focuses on mismatched lovers who see in each other only what they want to see, and decidedly not what is actually there. Clym Yeobright, the native of the title, returns to Hardy's fictional Egdon Heath determined to be a force for social progress. Dazzled by the beauty of Eustacia Vye, he imagines they're soul mates, woos and wins her, and enters into what is at first a passionate marriage. He soon discovers that what she really wants is a passport to a more exciting and sophisticated life, away from provincial England. Surrounding them are Clym's mother, strongly opposed to his marriage; Damon Wildeve, in love with Eustacia but married to Clym's cousin, Thomasin; and the oddly ambiguous observer Diggory Venn, whose frustrated love for Thomasin turns him into either a guardian angel or a jealous manipulator&#151;or perhaps both. This stew of curdled love and conflicting emotions can only boil over into tragedy, and the book's darkly ironic ending marks it as both a classically Victorian novel and a forerunner of the modernist fiction that followed it. Lauren Walsh teaches a writing seminar at Columbia University, where she is completing her Ph.D. in English and Comparative Literature.","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"2005","isbns":["1411433041","9781411433045"],"id":"OCLC-815948567"},{"publisher":"Macmillan","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"1988","isbns":["0333408144","9780333408148"],"id":"OCLC-823692798"},{"publisher":"Penguin books","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"1999","isbns":["0140435182","9780140435184"],"id":"OCLC-490645797"},{"publisher":"W.W.

While Wildeve is a step above the local rabble, Eustacia can never fully commit herself to him. Each time she considers it, she is held back by the thought that even he lacks something and that surely she can do better.","language":"en","title":"The return of the native","datePublished":"2012","isbns":["9781486416660","1486416667"],"id":"OCLC-818848810"},{"isbns":["0140431225","9780140431223"],"title":"The return of the native","id":"OCLC-225161286","language":"en","datePublished":"1986"},{"publisher":"W.W.

Eighteen years later the reformed Henchard has become the mayor of Casterbridge, but his past is set to haunt him and tragedy to dog him. Thus the scene is set for an epic tale of human weakness and resolution, despair and conflict, disappearance and reappearance, as both economic and emotional fortunes rise and fall against the backdrop of the Wessex Hardy loved and wrote about so powerfully.\"--Jacket.","language":"en","title":"The mayor of Casterbridge","datePublished":"1995","isbns":["1853268488","9781853268489"],"id":"OCLC-33002767"},{"publisher":"Penguin Books","language":"en","title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","datePublished":"1979","isbns":["014043125X","9780140431254"],"id":"OCLC-803106570"},{"publisher":"G.K.

Out--together with a new Introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Cunningham. Published to acclaim in England in 1915 and in America five years later, The Voyage Out marks Woolf's beginning as one of the twentieth century's most brilliant and prolific writers. Less formally experimental than her later novels, The Voyage Out none-theless clearly lays bare the poetic style and innovative technique--with its multiple figures of consciousness, its detailed portraits of characters' inner lives, and its constant shifting between the quotidian and the profound--that are the signature of Woolf's fiction. Rachel Vinrace, Woolf's first heroine, is a motherless young woman who, at twenty-four, embarks on a sea voyage with a party of other English folk to South America. Guileless, and with only a smattering of education, Rachel is taken under the wing of her aunt Helen, who desires to teach Rachel \"how to live.\"Arriving in Santa Marina, a village on the South American coast, Rachel and Helen are introduced to a group of English expatriates. Among them is the young, sensitive Terence Hewet, an aspiring writer, with whom Rachel falls in love. But theirs is ultimately a tale of doomed love, set against a chorus of other stories and other points of view, as the narrative shifts focus between its central and peripheral characters. E. M. Forster praised The Voyage Out as \"a book which attains unity as surely as Wuthering Heights, though by a different path.\" This edition includes a new Introduction by Michael Cunningham, bestselling author of The Hours. Cunningham at once unfolds an engaging short essay of Woolf's early life and career, an insightful exploration of the themes to which Woolf returns again and again in her fiction, and a spirited defense of the relevance and lasting importance of her art.

Originally published in serial form in Blackwood's Magazine in 1871-1872, it was at once a critical and popular success. 'No Victorian novel approaches Middlemarch in its width of reference, its intellectual power, or the imperturbable spaciousness of its narrative,' V. S. Pritchett noted. Set in a fictional Midlands town, the novel chronicles nineteenth-century English provincial life through its precisely delineated characters, weaving many stories into one richly textured tapestry. Eliot renders her vast cast with cool irony and intelligence: Dorothea Brooke, the 'latter-day St. Theresa,' intense, impassioned, and frustrated; Tertius Lydgate, the idealistic young doctor who comes to Middlemarch fired with the desire to spread the new science of medicine; Fred Vincy and his spoiled, pretentious sister Rosamond; Casaubon, Dorothea's elderly husband, for whom she feels at first awe and finally pity; and the many lesser characters who people this epic in a small landscape. Unsurpassed in its depiction of human nature, Middlemarch is one of the great works of world literature.","language":"en","title":"Middlemarch","datePublished":"2013","isbns":["0679641416","9780679641414"],"id":"OCLC-869407324"},{"publisher":"Gyldendals Bogklubber","language":"da","title":"Middlemarch","datePublished":"2004","isbns":["9788703004365","9788703004334","8703004368","8703004333"],"id":"OCLC-783726077"},{"publisher":"Twayne Publishers","description":"Historical context -- The importance of the work -- Critical reception -- A reading -- Enlarging our sympathies -- Seeing -- Feeling and knowledge -- Being heroic and constructive -- Making life beautiful -- Reform -- Selfishness -- Relationships -- Entering provincial life -- Radiance.","language":"en","title":"Middlemarch : a novel of reform","datePublished":"1988","isbns":["0805779817","0805780319","9780805779813","9780805780314"],"id":"OCLC-16900708"},{"isbns":["0679783318","9780679783312"],"title":"Middlemarch","id":"OCLC-44532643","language":"en","datePublished":"2000"},{"publisher":"Modern Library","language":"en","title":"Middlemarch","datePublished":"1994","isbns":["0679783318","9780679783312"],"id":"OCLC-704458578"},{"publisher":"Athenaeum-Polak & Van Gennep","description":"In de eerste helft van de 19e eeuw verliest een jonge ambitieuze arts zijn illusies en integriteit door zijn huwelijk met een mooi maar oppervlakkig meisje.","language":null,"title":"Middlemarch","datePublished":"2002","isbns":["9025311334","9789025311339"],"id":"OCLC-67067464"},{"publisher":"Penguin","language":"en","title":"Middlemarch","datePublished":"1994","isbns":["9780140230246","0140230246"],"id":"OCLC-154231699"},{"publisher":"Cideb Editrice","language":"en","title":"Middlemarch","datePublished":"2004","isbns":["9788853001665","8853001666"],"id":"OCLC-76858845"},{"publisher":"Macmillan","language":"en","title":"Middlemarch","datePublished":"2008","isbns":["9780230026865","0230026869"],"id":"OCLC-774023501"},{"publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Co.","language":"en","title":"Middlemarch","datePublished":"1968","isbns":["9780395051054","0395051053"],"id":"OCLC-804650197"},{"publisher":"Chatto and Windus","language":"en","title":"Middlemarch","datePublished":"1967","isbns":["070111245X","9780701112455"],"id":"OCLC-472780945"},{"publisher":"Oxford University Press","language":"en","title":"Middlemarch","datePublished":"1991","isbns":["0192817604","9780192817600"],"id":"OCLC-629773612"},{"publisher":"Athenaeum-Polak & Van Gennep","description":"In de eerste helft van de 19e eeuw verliest een jonge ambitieuze arts zijn illusies en integriteit door zijn huwelijk met een mooi maar oppervlakkig meisje.","language":null,"title":"Middlemarch","datePublished":"2004","isbns":["9789025311568","9025311563"],"id":"OCLC-66549770"},{"description":"Enter the provincial town of Middlemarch, circa 1830, where the individual destinies of tradespeople, middle classes, and country gentry shape and are shaped by the community.","language":null,"title":"Middlemarch.","datePublished":"a.d","isbns":["9780141439549","0141439548"],"id":"OCLC-438405507"},{"publisher":"Modern Library","language":"en","title":"Middlemarch George Eliot; introduction by A.S.

Endeavoring to find happiness without Ladislaw, whom she has come to care for deeply, Dorothea throws herself into the struggle for medical reforms advocated by the young Dr. Lydgate.

The heroine, Dorothea Brooke, longs to devote herself to some great cause and, for a time, expects to find it in her marriage to Rev. Mr. Casaubon, an aging scholar. Mr. Casaubon lives only eighteen months after their marriage, a sufficient period to disillusion her completely. He leaves her his estate, with the ill-intentioned proviso that she will forfeit if she marries his young cousin Will Ladislaw, whom she had seen frequently in Rome.
